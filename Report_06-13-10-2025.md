# Weekly Report (6 ‚Äì 13 Oct 2025)

## üìÖ Day-by-Day Progress

###  Monday, Oct 6
Started the week diving into the **Lumos introduction**.  
Learned that Lumos is a dApp framework used for both frontend and backend development on Nervos CKB.  
Reviewed the basic structure of a Lumos-based transaction, which includes creating a **transaction skeleton**, adding inputs and outputs, signing, and broadcasting it to the local CKB Dev Blockchain.  
Executed the first example using `node index.js` to observe how a transaction moves through each stage.

###  Tuesday, Oct 7
Focused on understanding **transaction structure** in detail ‚Äî inputs, outputs, dependencies, and witnesses.  
Explored how the **TransactionSkeleton** is built and updated using ImmutableJS and how `addDefaultCellDeps()` and `addDefaultWitnessPlaceholders()` simplify the process.  
Successfully sent a transaction and learned how to check its confirmation status using:  
`rpc get_transaction --hash <TX_HASH>`.

###  Wednesday, Oct 8
Encountered the **‚ÄúLive cell not found‚Äù** error when re-running the same transaction.  
Learned why a consumed (spent) cell cannot be reused ‚Äî once an input cell is used, it becomes a **dead cell**.  
Understood the importance of always using fresh live cells when building new transactions.  
Documented how to locate a valid out point with `ckb-cli rpc get_live_cell`.

###  Thursday, Oct 9
Completed the **Lab: Calculating Capacity Requirements**.  
Performed manual cell collection to find a live cell owned by the account `ckt1...gwga`.  
Added code to calculate transaction fees and output capacities, ensuring the change cell handled remaining CKBytes properly.  
Learned to express fees in **Shannons**, where 1 CKByte = 100,000,000 Shannons.

###  Friday, Oct 10
Studied **cell collection and indexers** in Nervos.  
Discovered how indexers improve performance by scanning and organizing cell data.  
Configured the `ckb.toml` file to enable the `Indexer` module.  
Tested the setup by running a small script using Lumos‚Äô `Indexer` class to confirm it was active and synced.

###  Saturday, Oct 11
Worked on the **Automated Cell Collection Lab**.  
Used the `collectCapacity()` function from Lumos‚Äô shared library to automatically gather input cells based on capacity needs.  
Configured the transaction with multiple inputs and two outputs (recipient + change cell).  
Understood how automated collection prevents errors and ensures valid capacity management.

###  Sunday, Oct 12
Started learning about **storing data in a cell**.  
Used both `ckb-cli` and Lumos to create a cell containing a file‚Äôs data (`Hello Nervos!`).  
Calculated the cell capacity as **61 CKBytes (minimum)** + **13 CKBytes (data)** = **74 CKBytes**.  
Validated the stored data by decoding the hex and verifying the hash using:  
`ckb-cli util blake2b --binary-path "./files/HelloNervos.txt"`.

###  Monday, Oct 13
Wrapped up the week by comparing **manual vs programmatic data storage**.  
Verified that Lumos transactions can reproduce the same results as CLI-based ones.  
Summarized lessons about capacity calculation, live vs dead cells, and data encoding.  
Prepared notes for the next topic: **custom scripts and lock mechanisms**.

##  Summary of the Week
This week provided hands-on experience in **Lumos transaction creation**, **cell management**, and **on-chain data storage**.  
Khalil practiced both manual and automated methods for managing transactions and learned how capacity defines blockchain storage costs on Nervos.  
The introduction to the Indexer and data storage workflows solidified understanding of how smart contracts and dApps interact with the CKB state layer.

---

##  Challenges & Notes
- Encountered repeated ‚Äúlive cell not found‚Äù errors before realizing cells can only be used once.  
- Had to troubleshoot `Indexer` setup by re-editing the `ckb.toml` configuration.  
- Capacity math (in Shannons) was tricky at first but now feels intuitive.  
- Noted that data-heavy dApps need careful CKByte planning due to storage costs.

---

##  Goals for Next Week
- Begin **custom lock script development** using Rust.  
- Learn more about **type scripts** and **transaction validation logic**.  
- Explore how Lumos handles **script deployment** and debugging.  
- Experiment with **data retrieval** from cells using Lumos indexer queries.
