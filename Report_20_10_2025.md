# Weekly Report (13 – 20 Oct 2025)

## Day-by-Day Progress

### Monday, Oct 13
Started exploring **CKB-SDK-Rust**.  
* Learned that it provides RPC access, data structure definitions, transaction assembly, and signature unlocking support.  
* Set up Rust project using `cargo new --bin ckb-rust-example` and added `ckb-sdk = "3.2.0"` dependency.  
* Built project with `cargo build` and ran unit tests via `make test`.  
* Explored CKB client connections to **Testnet, Devnet, and Mainnet** using `CkbRpcClient`.

### Tuesday, Oct 14
Focused on **building transactions with Rust SDK**.  
* Prepared sender and receiver addresses and defined transaction capacity.  
* Used `SecpCkbRawKeySigner` and `SecpSighashUnlocker` for signing.  
* Built transactions using `CapacityTransferBuilder` and `CapacityBalancer`.  
* Learned to resolve cell dependencies and collect live cells automatically.  

### Wednesday, Oct 15
Practiced **address management in CKB using Rust**.  
* Generated new addresses from private keys using secp256k1 and Blake2b hashing.  
* Parsed addresses to retrieve network and Script information.  
* Learned about deprecated short and full Bech32 addresses and the recommended modern format.

### Thursday, Oct 16
Started with **CKB-SDK-Go**.  
* Installed Go SDK and initialized a project using `go mod init ckb-go-example`.  
* Installed dependency: `github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-go/v2`.  
* Built Go client and connected to **Testnet** RPC.  
* Called JSON-RPC APIs to fetch block information.

### Friday, Oct 17
Focused on **building and signing transactions with Go SDK**.  
* Constructed `TransactionWithScriptGroups` with inputs, outputs, and cell deps.  
* Learned to sign transactions using private keys and send to CKB network.  
* Practiced generating new addresses and converting public keys to addresses (`secp256k1_blake160_signhash_all`).  
* Parsed addresses to inspect network and Script details.

### Saturday, Oct 18
Explored **CCC Playground** for interactive CKB development.  
* Learned the features: interactive editor, transaction visualization, multi-tab interface, debugging, and code sharing.  
* Practiced writing and loading code directly in the Playground, including step-by-step debugging.  
* Explored Nostr protocol for sharing code snippets and generating collaborative links.

### Sunday, Oct 19
Worked on **JavaScript/TypeScript SDK (CCC)**.  
* Installed packages for NodeJS, React, Web Components.  
* Learned transaction composing using `ccc.Transaction.from`, completing inputs and fees, and sending transactions.  
* Explored signing and verifying messages, hashing messages, and transferring CKB tokens through CCC.  
* Practiced building interactive UI components in React for transaction management.

### Monday, Oct 20
Continued **CCC SDK development and transaction management**.  
* Implemented React components to handle CKB transactions: sign, verify, hash, and transfer tokens.  
* Integrated CCC functions with state management and logging for better debugging.  
* Tested multi-step transaction workflows including calculating maximum transferable amount and completing transaction fees.  
* Ensured safe network usage by verifying Testnet vs Mainnet connections in CCC Playground.

## Summary of the Week
This week provided deep exposure to **multi-language CKB SDKs**: Rust, Go, and JavaScript/TypeScript (CCC).  
* Hands-on experience with transaction building, signing, and sending on both Rust and Go.  
* Learned best practices for address generation, parsing, and managing capacity in CKB.  
* Explored interactive development environments like **CCC Playground**, enhancing debugging and collaborative coding.  
* Developed React components for transaction management using CCC SDK.

---

## Challenges & Notes
* Setting up multi-language SDK environments required careful version and dependency management.  
* Understanding CKB address formats and conversion between private keys, public keys, and addresses was tricky at first.  
* Debugging transactions in CCC Playground involved learning step-by-step execution and console logging.  
* Managing capacities and fees across SDKs highlighted differences in Rust, Go, and JS approaches.  

---

## Goals for Next Week
* Explore **custom scripts and lock mechanisms** in Rust and Go SDKs.  
* Develop more **interactive transaction UIs** using CCC SDK in React.  
* Dive deeper into **cell management, dependency resolution, and automated transaction workflows**.  
* Start integrating **multi-network support** for Testnet, Devnet, and Mainnet in client applications.
