## Monday — 24 Nov 2025  
**Topic:** Introduction to Nodes & Why They Matter  

I started the week by studying what a Nervos CKB node is and why it plays a central role in the network.  
I learned that running a node allows you to validate transactions, maintain the blockchain state, and contribute to decentralization.  
I reviewed the benefits such as trustless verification, full transparency, and increased privacy when interacting with on-chain data.  
I also explored the trade-offs: resource consumption, syncing time, and the fact that not everyone needs a local node depending on their use cases.

**Topic:** Node Types — Full Node vs Light Node  

Today, I focused on understanding the differences between **full nodes** and **light clients**.  
I studied how a full node stores the entire chain data, validates every block, and maintains the full set of live cells, while a light client only downloads block headers.  
I also analyzed the resource requirements for each type and the security trade-offs — full nodes offer trustless validation while light clients rely on full nodes.  
Finally, I learned how CKB’s economic model (1 CKB = 1 byte) naturally limits state growth and protects decentralization.

**Topic:** Node Resource Requirements & Practical Considerations  

I reviewed the hardware specs required to run different node modes (Mainnet, Testnet, Devnet).  
I learned how disk size, CPU, RAM, and bandwidth influence sync performance and node stability.  
I also explored why SSDs are essential for fast syncing and how operating system sleep settings can silently pause node progress.  
Additionally, I studied when running your own node is necessary, and when using a public RPC is good enough.

**Topic:** Installing CKB (Release, Source Build, & Docker)  

Today's focus was installation methods.  
I reviewed the three main ways to install CKB:  
- Download prebuilt binaries  
- Build the project from source using Rust  
- Run a containerized node using Docker  

I went through each method's steps and the required dependencies.  
I also learned how to verify installation using `ckb --version` and `ckb-cli --version`, and how to handle macOS security prompts when launching unsigned binaries.

**Topic:** Running a Mainnet & Testnet Node  

I studied how to initialize, configure, and run nodes for Mainnet and Testnet.  
I reviewed commands such as:  
- `ckb init --chain mainnet`  
- `ckb run`  
- `ckb-cli rpc sync_state`  

I learned how Initial Block Download (IBD) works, why syncing can take days, and how to check when the node becomes fully synced.  
I also reviewed node discovery rules and how to make a node visible and connectable using inbound P2P connections.

**Topic:** Running a Devnet (OffCKB & Manual Setup)  

I explored Devnet environments for local development.  
I learned how to start a Devnet quickly using:  
- `npm install -g @offckb/cli`  
- `offckb node`  

Then I studied the manual Devnet setup:  
initializing the chain, configuring the block assembler, adjusting block intervals, modifying epoch length, and understanding mining behavior using Dummy-Worker or Eaglesong-Worker.  
I also reviewed configuration files like `ckb.toml` and `specs/dev.toml`.

## Sunday — 30 Nov 2025  
**Topic:** Transfers, Genesis Cells, and Docker-based Nodes  

I ended the week by learning how to interact with accounts and CKBytes using `ckb-cli`.  
I reviewed how to:  
- create accounts  
- get balances  
- transfer CKBytes  
- import genesis-issued cells for Devnet  

I then studied how to run nodes entirely inside Docker containers for both Mainnet and Testnet.  
This included initializing mounted volumes, copying config files, updating the block assembler, and launching the miner inside a container.  
I now have a complete overview of running CKB nodes across all environments.

## End of Weekly Log  
This week gave me a full understanding of how CKB nodes work, the differences between node types, installation methods, resource requirements, Devnet setup, and how to run Mainnet/Testnet nodes using native binaries or Docker.
