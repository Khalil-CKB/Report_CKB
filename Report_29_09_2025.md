# Weekly Report  
**Period:** 22/09/2025 â†’ 29/09/2025

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This week, the focus shifted from theory to **hands-on practice on the CKB testnet**.  
We learned how to connect wallets, view live cells, interact with blocks, and explored the **NFT ecosystem on CKB** with an introduction to **CoTA and Spore standards**.  

---

## ðŸ§© Key Learnings  

### 1. Connecting Wallets  
- Used **MetaMask** to connect to the CKB testnet.  
- Upon connection, accounts were assigned **10 Cells (100 CKB capacity each)**.  
- Wallet CKB balance = **sum of capacity of all live cells the wallet can unlock**.  
- Viewing live cells:  
  - Can refresh with *Fetch Cells*.  
  - Delay of ~10s before cells appear after allocation.  

---

### 2. Blocks & Transactions  
- Testnet UI displays **latest 9 blocks**.  
- Each block shows its transactions.  
- Transactions are **more complex in practice** than in theory but still follow the same principle:  
  - `input => output`.  
- Clicking on a transaction displays detailed JSON.  

---

### 3. Testnet Chain Configuration  
- **Prefix:** `ckt` indicates testnet chain.  
- **Scripts (built-in contracts in genesis block):**  
  - `SECP256K1_BLAKE160`: Default lock script for ownership.  
  - `SECP256K1_BLAKE160_MULTISIG`: Multi-sig version.  
  - `DAO`: NervosDAO contract (for staking, advanced use cases).  

---

### 4. NFTs on CKB â€“ Introduction  
- Nervos has a **two-layer ecosystem**:  
  - **L1 (CKB)** â†’ Cell model + CKB-VM.  
  - **L2 (Godwoken)** â†’ EVM-compatible.  
- Differences in models lead to **different NFT standards**.  
- **L1 benefits:**  
  - Advanced cell model NFT standards.  
  - CoTA standard = lowest fees among L1 blockchains.  
  - Spore standard = fully on-chain storage of data (including images).  
- **L2 benefits:**  
  - Full EVM compatibility (ERC721/1155).  
  - More mature tooling & bridges.  

---

### 5. History of NFT Standards  
- **2014:** Early NFTs appear.  
- **2017:** CryptoKitties â†’ massive success, Ethereum congestion.  
- **2018:** ERC721 finalized â†’ single NFT standard.  
- **2018+:** ERC1155 introduced â†’ multiple NFTs in one contract.  
- Issues with early NFT standards:  
  - **High costs** during congestion.  
  - **Non-permanent content** (most NFTs only reference external data).  

---

### 6. CoTA Standard (Compact Token Aggregator)  
- Uses **Sparse Merkle Trees (SMTs)** for efficient proof of ownership.  
- Stores only a **32-byte root hash** on-chain in a *CoTA cell*.  
- Actual ownership data managed off-chain but provable via SMT proofs.  
- Requires a **one-time deposit (< $0.50)** to create a CoTA cell.  
- Transaction costs: **< $0.01** per mint/transfer.  
- **Use cases:**  
  - Art, collectibles, games, event ticketing, tokenized assets.  

---

### 7. Spore Standard  
- Stores **all NFT content fully on-chain**.  
- Each NFT = its own cell containing metadata + content.  
- **Costs:**  
  - 1 CKB = 1 byte of storage.  
  - Higher cost for large NFTs (images/music).  
- Guarantees **maximum permanence & availability** (replicated across all nodes).  
- **Use cases:**  
  - High-value digital art.  
  - Pixel art (low data).  
  - Tokenized real estate, stocks, loans.

### 8. Comparing CoTA vs Spore  

| Attribute                   | CoTA Standard           | Spore Standard         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Setup Cost                  | <$0.50 (one-time)       | N/A                   |
| Minting Cost                | <$0.01                  | Depends on content     |
| Transfer Cost               | <$0.01                  | <$0.01                 |
| Model                       | Account model           | Cell (UTXO) model      |
| Refundable State Rent       | âœ… Yes                  | âœ… Yes                 |
| Full On-Chain Content       | â›” No                   | âœ… Yes                 |
| Primary Benefit             | Low fees                | Strong permanence      |

ðŸ‘‰ **Summary:**  
- **CoTA** = best for low-cost, high-volume NFTs.  
- **Spore** = best for permanent, high-value NFTs.  

---

## âœ… Summary of Progress  
- Gained hands-on practice with **wallet connection and live cell management**.  
- Explored **block & transaction structures** on the testnet.  
- Learned about **built-in scripts** (locks, DAO).  
- Studied the **evolution of NFT standards** (ERC721 â†’ ERC1155).  
- Understood **CoTA (low cost)** vs **Spore (permanence)** NFT standards on CKB.  

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps  
- Dive deeper into **transaction construction** on CKB.  
- Practice **minting NFTs** using both CoTA and Spore.  
- Explore **SDKs and dev tools** for CKB NFT standards.  
- Experiment with bridging between **L1 and L2 (Godwoken)**.
