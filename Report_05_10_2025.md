# Weekly Report  
**Period:** 16/09/2025 → 21/09/2025  

---

##  Overview  
This week, the focus was on understanding the **CKB (Common Knowledge Base)** blockchain model.  
We explored how CKB works at its core by analyzing the concept of **cells**, how they store data, and how ownership/validation works through scripts.  

---

##  Key Learnings  

### 1. What is CKB?  
- CKB is based on the concept of **cells**, which function similarly to Bitcoin’s UTXO model.  
- **Cells** = the fundamental unit of state on the blockchain.  
  - **Live cells** = unspent cells.  
  - **Dead cells** = spent cells.  
- Each transaction consumes existing cells and creates new ones → continuous cycle of creation and destruction.  

---

### 2. Cells and Storage  
- A cell can store **any type of data** (text, hash, binary, etc.).  
- **Capacity = storage size of a cell**, measured in **CKB tokens**.  
  - `1 CKB = 1 byte`.  
- Example:  
  - 100 CKB → 100 bytes of storage.  
  - Storing "Dream of the Red Chamber" (~780,000 Chinese words) would require ~1.56M CKB.  

**On-chain storage is extremely valuable and limited.**

---

### 3. Cell Structure  
```js
Cell: {
  capacity: HexString; // Size of storage space
  lock: Script;        // Ownership control
  type: Script;        // Optional script defining purpose
  data: HexString;     // Arbitrary stored data
}
```

- **capacity**: Total space (in shannons, where `1 CKB = 10^8 shannons`).  
- **lock**: Ensures only the rightful owner can spend the cell.  
- **type**: Defines behavior (smart contracts, tokens, etc.).  
- **data**: Stores arbitrary information.  

⚠️ Rule: **Total size of all fields ≤ cell capacity.**

---

### 4. Scripts (Ownership & Validation)  
```js
Script: {
  code_hash: HexString;
  args: HexString;
  hash_type: Uint8; // {0: "data", 1: "type", 2: "data1"}
}
```

- **Lock script** = default lock (who owns the cell).  
- **Type script** = optional, adds additional rules (e.g., token issuance).  
- Ownership is proven through cryptographic signatures → similar to Bitcoin.  
- If a cell has no proper lock, anyone can spend it → **dangerous!**  

---

### 5. Code Location  
- Script code is **not stored directly** in the cell.  
- Instead, it is stored in another **dependency cell (CellDep)**.  
- `code_hash + hash_type` determines how to retrieve the code.  

Example: **SUDT (Simple User Defined Token)** uses a type script stored in a dep cell.  
- Developers just reference the same dep cell instead of deploying the code repeatedly.  

---

### 6. Resilience & Safety  
- **Built-in scripts** are stored in special cells with a **never unlockable lock**, ensuring the code lasts forever.  
- If a dep cell (custom lock) is destroyed, it can be **redeployed** in a new cell and re-referenced.  

---

## Summary of Progress  
- Understood the **fundamental concept of CKB as a chain of cells**.  
- Learned how **capacity (1 CKB = 1 byte)** defines on-chain storage.  
- Explored the **cell data structure** and the importance of locks.  
- Reviewed how **scripts** (lock/type) enforce ownership and behavior.  
- Analyzed how **code is stored in dependency cells (CellDeps)** and why this design is efficient.  
- Covered **resilience mechanisms** (never unlockable lock for built-ins, redeploy for customs).  

---

##  Next Steps  
- Explore practical examples of transactions on CKB.  
- Experiment with creating and unlocking cells.  
- Study how dApps use type scripts (e.g., SUDT issuance).  
- Review consensus and economic model (CKB tokenomics).
