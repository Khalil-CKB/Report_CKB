# Weekly Progress Report

**Week:** 10 November 2025 – 17 November 2025

## Daily Activities

### Monday, 10 November 2025
- Explored CKB Rust script development fundamentals and script template structures
- Investigated Molecule 0.8.0 updates, focusing on Vec-to-bytes transition and RISC-V atomic instruction implications
- Analyzed atomic behavior handling approaches in Molecule-based projects, including ckb-std feature configurations

### Tuesday, 11 November 2025
- Configured project development environment with required dependencies:
  - Unix-based tooling setup
  - Rust with riscv64 target installation
  - Clang 18+ environment configuration
  - cargo-generate tool installation
- Practiced workspace template generation using cargo generate command

### Wednesday, 12 November 2025
- Generated initial workspace project and analyzed directory architecture:
  - Cargo.toml workspace configuration
  - Makefile recipe structure
  - Scripts directory organization
  - Tests framework setup
- Documented Makefile functionality for contract compilation and execution workflows

### Thursday, 13 November 2025
- Created initial contract crate using workspace generation commands
- Experimented with contract customization options:
  - Multiple contract generation within single workspace
  - Template selection (atomics-contract, stack-reorder-contract)
  - Destination path configuration for crate organization
- Reviewed available template types and their specific use cases

### Friday, 14 November 2025
- Implemented contract building and testing workflows:
  - Debug and release mode compilation
  - Selective contract building techniques
  - Test execution and validation procedures
- Studied reproducible build practices through containerized development environments

### Saturday, 15 November 2025
- Developed standalone contract crates using dedicated template:
  - Initialized standalone project structure
  - Configured build and test pipelines
  - Applied code quality checks (clippy, formatting)
- Compared standalone vs workspace development approaches

### Sunday, 16 November 2025
- Generated native simulators for contract debugging and validation
- Practiced simulator creation with proper CRATE parameter usage
- Reviewed naming conventions and structural requirements for simulator integration

### Monday, 17 November 2025
- Evaluated workspace-based versus standalone contract development methodologies
- Documented flexibility trade-offs, build workflow differences, and template structures
- Prepared development environment for upcoming contract implementation phase

## Challenges & Notes
- Molecule atomic feature configuration required precise Rust compiler flag management
- Workspace architecture comprehension was essential for efficient development setup
- Standalone contracts offer greater freedom but require more manual configuration than workspace templates

## Goals for Next Week
- Implement and test basic smart contracts using established templates
- Apply reproducible build practices to ensure consistent binary outputs
- Experiment with native simulator for contract logic validation pre-deployment
- Begin integrating learned concepts into practical contract development
