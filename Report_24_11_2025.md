# Weekly Report JavaScript Quick Start (CKB JS VM) 
**Period:** 17 Nov 2025 → 24 Nov 2025  
---

## 📅 Monday — 17 Nov 2025  
**Topic: Getting Started with JS on CKB**  
I reviewed the JS Quick Start documentation and focused on understanding the basic tools required to run JavaScript inside CKB-VM, such as `ckb-js-vm` and `ckb-debugger`.  
I executed the first “Hello World” example using the debugger and confirmed I could run JavaScript code inside the VM.  
This gave me a clear view of how command-line arguments are passed through `--` and how scripts log output inside CKB-VM.

## 📅 Tuesday — 18 Nov 2025  
**Topic: Project Bootstrapping (TypeScript)**  
I learned how to scaffold a full JS-VM contract project using:  
`pnpm create ckb-js-vm-app`.  
This generates both the on-chain script project and the testing project.  
I studied the project structure, the role of `tsc`, `esbuild`, and how bundling works.  
I also explored the difference between `.js` bundles and `.bc` bytecode bundles.

## 📅 Wednesday — 19 Nov 2025  
**Topic: Building and Executing Contracts**  
I examined the build process (`pnpm build`) and learned how JS code is transformed into optimized bytecode for CKB-VM.  
I practiced running bytecode using:  
`ckb-debugger --read-file dist/*.bc --bin ckb-js-vm -- -r`  
This helped me understand performance differences between JS and bytecode, and why `.bc` files drastically reduce cycle consumption (~80%).

## 📅 Thursday — 20 Nov 2025  
**Topic: Testing Smart Contracts with ckb-testtool**  
I studied how real on-chain behavior is simulated using `Resource`, `Transaction`, and `Verifier`.  
I learned how to embed a JS contract inside a mock transaction, add inputs, outputs, cell data, and witnesses.  
I reviewed the test example for Hello World and how the VM handles different script types and validation paths.

## 📅 Friday — 21 Nov 2025  
**Topic: Working with Script Arguments & Witnesses**  
I focused on how script arguments are structured, especially the 35-byte VM-loader prefix.  
I learned how to read arguments and witness data using the `HighLevel` API from `@ckb-js-std/core`.  
I reviewed the example using `simple-print-args` to load script args and witness values from group inputs.

## 📅 Saturday — 22 Nov 2025  
**Topic: Advanced Testing & Witness Handling**  
I read the example showing how `WitnessArgs` are used inside tests.  
I studied the structure of lock scripts embedding JS bytecode, and how `hexFrom(witness.toBytes())` is used to encode witness objects.  
I also learned why Jest must run with `--maxWorkers=1` due to stdin constraints in ckb-debugger.

## 📅 Sunday — 23 Nov 2025  
**Topic: Building JS-VM & Deployment Knowledge**  
I learned how ckb-js-vm itself is built using LLVM and Makefile.  
I examined the reproducible build script used to generate deterministic binaries.  
I also reviewed the deployment details such as `code_hash`, `hash_type`, and `dep_type` for a real on-chain deployment on testnet.

---

## 📅 Monday — 24 Nov 2025  
**Topic: Command Line Options, Bytecode Compilation & Security**  
I explored all command-line options such as `-c`, `-e`, `-r`, and `-f`.  
I learned how JS code can be compiled into QuickJS bytecode for performance and what limitations exist (not portable between versions).  
I also studied memory layout, safe exit codes, handling of VM errors, dynamic module loading risks, and best practices to avoid security issues.

## 🔚 End of Weekly Log  
This week was focused entirely on understanding how JavaScript executes inside CKB-VM, how to scaffold, build, test, deploy, and secure JS-based smart contracts on CKB.
